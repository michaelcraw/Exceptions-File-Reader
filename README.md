# Exceptions-File-Reader
Exceptions.java
This program will ask the user to enter a name for a file. If the name of the file is wrong, the program will output "file doesnt exit" and then exit. If the user types the correct name of the file it will count how many lines are in the file, sum all the numbers, and average the numbers.
